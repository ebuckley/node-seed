#Seed.

This is just a simple starting point for a nodejs express web service. There is a pre configured micro gruntscript that will compile then deploy the project to a remote server. I am being un-opinionated about test framework but opinionated about template (ejs included).

## Getting Started

- cd src/ && node app
- open http://localhost:3000
